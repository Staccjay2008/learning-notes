### Lead and Lag time:
Every task can have pre-requisites and co-requisites, and each has lead time and lag time.  
Lead time is the amount of time to get all the necessary pieces together to do the task.
And lag time is the amount of time after the task to clean up the mess.

### Project management thinking from Larrie's definition
Currently, your thinking centers around the problem domain - solving the problem taking into consideration all other exacerbating factors.  When you're the project lead, you have manage those tasks from the problem domain in time and available resources and skill sets.  So, if you think about the problem as an x-y plane, add z (time) to it, and now you have a spatial entity to think about - and you can full on multi-dimensional if you want, but it makes your brain hurt.

### DRG: 
Reimbursement purpose; Each DRG catogory, may have different severe level. No matter how many things did in the same DRG, the insurance company will reimburse same amount of money.Since the money is same for each category, if we want to know the condition stage/ serverity of the inhospital stay, we could use DRG servere level and days of inpatient stay.
